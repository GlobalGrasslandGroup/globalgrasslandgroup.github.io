We have spent two weeks in Kruger National Park leaning lots at the 22nd savanna science network meeting, seeing incredible wildlife and introducing the Global Grassy Group protocol on the experimental burn plots.

Working with members of the South African National Parks Scientific Services Department, we collected data about the ecology and composition of herbaceous plant communities across four fire regimes. About 150 species were recorded, using the Skukuza herbarium to check the names of our pressed specimens.

We plan to carry out training on sampling ground-layer diversity again in Kruger next March, so do reach out if you are interested in joining us for some fun science and plenty of grasses!
